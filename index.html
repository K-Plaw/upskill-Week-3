                <p> This is a simple website about me and my tech journey! I'm an entry-level Front-end developer, but for now, let's take a fun journey down history lane to see just when I started.</p>
                <p>I started my web dev journey when I was in secondary school. We had a new course added to our curriculumn called Coding and Robotics. I didn't quite like the robotics class, or maybe it was just because of the person teaching. May his soul rest in peace🕊️✨. 
                    But when the second part of the course was introduced, every fibre of my being was lit up, and the highest amount of dopamine surged through my body like a flood. From the way the assistant tutor introduced the course to us , I couldn't help but dig deep into Youtube videos to learn as much as I can, and <a href="www.youtube.com/EJ-Media">EJ EJ-Media</a> was right there to help out.
                    But sadly, my journey came to an end when my laptop got bad, and my spare laptop had too many bugs to be useful, so my web dev journey was paused.</p>
                <p> &nbsp;A couple years later, A family relative invited me for a tech program - Uyo DevFest 2024, and Learnable by Genesys Tech Hub waas one of the partners there. A similar surge of dopamine rushed through my body again when I heard they have a Web Development Track, and most importantly, they were giving promo discounts for all attendees of the Dev Fest😂😂. 
                    I played my ball, and lucky for me, to God be the glory, I got the hugest discount they had to offer. The next week, I pulled out what I could, and successfully enrolled into Learnable by Genesys Tech Hub after a their enrolment processes and procedures. </p>
                <p> I pushed through the 6-month program, and again, to God be the glory, I came out very scathed😂😂. But the experieces and knowledge gained was veryyyy worth it. After the Learnable internship ended, I saw an opening to give back the knowledge I was taught to upcoming interns via Genesys' sub-program "upSkill," and that's where I currently am. I'm also doing a couple side gigs and personal projects, and it's going pretty smooth. </p>
                <p>So, that's about it concerning my Web Dev Journey. I'd love to hear about yours.</p>
